## v2.0.0 - 2025-11-26

### Added

- Added a new background image to the project to enhance the visual design.
- Added a `decodeHtmlEntities` utility function to the string utils, providing a robust way to handle HTML entity decoding.
- Extended the MUI theme to include a `tertiary` color palette option, allowing for more flexible and consistent theming across the application.
- Added `@phosphor-icons/react` and `react-social-icons` to the project's dependencies, providing a wider range of icons for use in the application.

### Changed

- The first accordion on the resume page is now expanded by default, improving the user experience.
- Updated the title on the resume page from "Spencer Pope - Web Developer & Software Engineer" to "Spencer Pope - Technical Consultant".
- Refactored the root page to fetch content from a WordPress backend, replacing the `SpenpoLanding` component with a new, more dynamic implementation.
- Updated the application's navigation structure by replacing 'products' with 'labs' and 'contact' with 'consulting' in the `Tabs` type definition.

### Fixed

- Updated the projects page to use the `WP_ROOT` constant when splitting the `dirtyProject` variable, making the code more robust and maintainable.
- Updated the `include` array in `tsconfig.json` to include `**/*.d.ts` files, ensuring that all TypeScript declaration files are correctly processed by the compiler.
